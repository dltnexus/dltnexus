#PROMPT:#
Alright, I have to create a detailed textual description of a state diagram for the workflow of issues in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/dltnexus/dltnexus. This repository is a public hub for Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) ideas and research, and it uses GitHub Issues to track the lifecycle of these ideas from proposal to resolution.

First, I need to define the key states that an issue might go through. The prompt suggests some states, which seem appropriate for a research-oriented open-source project. Let me list them out and make sure they fit the context of this repository.

New: This is the initial state when an issue is created to propose an idea or topic. It makes sense as the starting point.
Discussion: In this state, the community discusses the proposal’s merit or feasibility. Given that the repository is a hub for ideas, community input is likely crucial.
Research: The issue is assigned for in-depth exploration, possibly labeled as "deep dive" as mentioned in the repository's issues. This state is particularly relevant since the repository focuses on research-intensive topics.
Review: After research, the findings or outcomes are evaluated. This could involve reviewing the research results to decide the next steps.
Decision: Here, a determination is made to implement, archive, or reject the idea based on the review.
Implementation: If the decision is to proceed, the idea is developed or acted upon.
Closed: The final state, where the issue is resolved, either after implementation or if it's closed without action (e.g., rejected or archived).
These states seem logical and cover the lifecycle of an issue from proposal to resolution.

Next, I need to detail the transitions between these states, including specific actions that trigger each transition and the conditions or decisions that dictate the flow.

Let me think about how an issue might move from one state to another.

From New to Discussion: This transition likely occurs automatically when the issue is created and opened for community input. The action triggering this could be the creation of the issue.
From Discussion to Research: If the community finds the idea promising, it might be labeled as "deep dive" for further research. So, the action could be adding the "deep dive" label, and the condition is community consensus or maintainer approval.
From Discussion to Closed: If the idea doesn't gain support or is deemed not feasible, it can be closed directly. The condition here is lack of support or negative feedback.
From Research to Review: Once the research is completed, the findings are submitted, possibly through comments or linked documents, triggering the move to the review state.
From Review to Decision: After the review is conducted, a decision is made based on the evaluation. This could involve maintainers or key contributors deciding the next steps.
From Decision to Implementation: If the decision is to implement, the issue moves to the implementation state. This might involve assigning developers or creating tasks for development.
From Decision to Closed: If the decision is to reject or archive the idea, the issue is closed.
From Implementation to Closed: Once the implementation is completed, the issue is closed, indicating resolution.
Additionally, there might be loops or variations in the workflow.

For example:

From Review back to Research: If the review finds that more research is needed, the issue could loop back to the research state.
From Implementation back to Review: If during implementation, new issues or questions arise that require further research or review.
However, to keep it simple, I'll focus on the primary transitions and mention possible loops.

Now, considering the repository-specific features, I know that they use the "deep dive" label for research-intensive topics. So, in the transition from Discussion to Research, applying the "deep dive" label could be the specific action.

Moreover, the repository mentions potential integration with external platforms like Stack Exchange or Kialo in some issues. This might not directly affect the state transitions but could be part of the research or implementation phases.

For instance, during Research, contributors might explore integrating with these platforms, and the findings would be reviewed accordingly.

Also, it's possible that the repository uses GitHub Projects or custom labels to manage workflow stages. For example, they might have a project board with columns corresponding to some of these states, like "Backlog," "In Research," "In Review," "In Implementation," "Done."

If that's the case, moving an issue between columns would represent state transitions.

Since I don't have direct access to the repository, I'll assume a typical setup where labels and possibly project boards are used to track progress.

Let me try to incorporate that into the description.

For the structure, I need to present this in a clear, structured format that makes it easy to visualize the states and transitions.

I think using bullet points or a numbered list for states and then sub-points for transitions would work well.

Alternatively, I could describe it as a list of states with their possible transitions.

Let me try to outline it.

States:

New
Description: An issue is created to propose an idea or topic.
Transitions to: Discussion
Discussion
Description: The community discusses the proposal’s merit or feasibility.
Transitions to:
Research: If labeled "deep dive" or accepted for further study.
Closed: If not pursued due to lack of support.
Research
Description: The issue is assigned for in-depth exploration.
Transitions to: Review (when research findings are submitted)
Review
Description: Research findings or outcomes are evaluated.
Transitions to:
Decision: When review is complete.
Research: If more investigation is needed (loop back).
Decision
Description: A determination is made to implement, archive, or reject the idea.
Transitions to:
Implementation: If approved.
Closed: If rejected or archived.
Implementation
Description: The idea is developed or acted upon.
Transitions to: Closed (when implementation is complete)
Closed
Description: The issue is resolved, either implemented or closed without action.
No further transitions.
Additionally, I can mention that these states might be tracked using GitHub labels (e.g., "new," "discussion," "deep dive," "review," "decision," "implementation," "closed") or through columns in a GitHub Project board.

For example:

An issue starts in the "New" column or with a "new" label.
Moves to "Discussion" column or gets a "discussion" label when opened for community input.
If accepted, moves to "Research" or gets "deep dive" label.
And so on.
This way, the workflow can be visualized either through labels or project boards.

To make it more concrete, I can suggest possible label names or project columns that correspond to each state.

But since I'm not sure about the exact labels they use, I'll keep it general.

Also, regarding the external platforms, I can mention that during the Research or Implementation states, integration with platforms like Stack Exchange or Kialo might be explored, as seen in some issues.

For instance, in the Research state, contributors might investigate the feasibility of integrating with these platforms, and the findings would influence the Review and Decision states.

Similarly, in Implementation, actual development work might involve creating connections or features related to these platforms.

But since this is speculative, I'll keep it as a side note.

Now, to ensure the description is comprehensive and adaptable, I should also consider that the repository might have variations in the workflow for different types of issues.

For example, some issues might be purely for discussion without leading to research, while others might be fast-tracked to implementation if they are straightforward.

However, for the sake of simplicity, I'll stick with the main workflow described.

Alternatively, I can mention that not all issues go through every state; some might skip certain stages based on the nature of the proposal.

For instance, a simple bug fix might go directly from New to Implementation to Closed, bypassing Discussion and Research.

But given that the repository seems focused on ideas and research, most issues probably follow the full workflow.

Wait, actually, looking back at the web results, the issues mentioned are about deep dives into various topics, so likely, the workflow includes the research component.

Nevertheless, to make the description more flexible, I can indicate that the workflow can be adapted based on the issue type.

For example, for research-intensive issues, the full workflow is followed, while for other types, some states might be skipped.

But perhaps that's overcomplicating it.

I think providing the main workflow with the understanding that variations exist is sufficient.

Finally, to structure the description for easy visualization, I'll use a format that lists each state with its description and possible transitions, including the actions or conditions for each transition.

Let me put it all together.

Closed
Description: The issue is resolved and closed, signifying either successful implementation or a decision not to pursue further (e.g., rejection or archival).
Transitions: None; this is the terminal state.
Loops and Variations
Review → Research Loop: If the review reveals gaps or insufficient data, the issue returns to the Research state for further exploration. This ensures robust findings before a decision is made.
Early Closure from Discussion: Some issues may skip Research and subsequent states if they lack community support or relevance, moving directly to Closed.
Bypassing Implementation: Issues rejected or archived during the Decision state transition straight to Closed, avoiding Implementation.
Flexible Paths: Depending on the issue type, certain states may be skipped. For example, straightforward fixes might jump from New to Implementation, though most DLT ideas likely follow the full research-oriented workflow.
Repository-Specific Features
"Deep Dive" Label: The repository uses the "deep dive" label to identify research-intensive topics, typically applied during the transition from Discussion to Research. This signals a commitment to thorough investigation, aligning with the DLT research focus.
External Platform Integration: Some issues mention potential integration with platforms like Stack Exchange (for Q&A) or Kialo (for structured debates). During Research, contributors might explore these integrations, with findings influencing Review and Decision. In Implementation, development could involve building connections to these platforms.
GitHub Projects or Custom Labels: The workflow may leverage GitHub Projects, with columns mirroring the states (e.g., "New," "Discussion," "Research," "Review," "Decision," "Implementation," "Closed"). Alternatively, custom labels (e.g., "discussion," "deep dive," "review") could track progress, inferred from typical open-source practices.
