Usage
Connecting to a Blockchain Network
pythonCopyfrom dltnexus.connectors import EthereumConnector

# Initialize a connection to an Ethereum network

connector = EthereumConnector(network="mainnet")

# Get the latest block

latest_block = connector.get_latest_block()
print(f"Latest block number: {latest_block.number}")
Visualizing the Knowledge Graph
pythonCopyfrom dltnexus.visualization import KnowledgeGraph

# Initialize the knowledge graph with data

kg = KnowledgeGraph(data_source="ethereum")

# Generate a 3D visualization

kg.visualize_3d(output_path="./graph.html")
